# My build of dwm

This here is my patched build of the suckless dwm.
This is up here purely for my convenience, but feel free to use it if you so desire.

### Included patches:

* [Centered master layout](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/centeredmaster/)
    * Extra layout for when I want something in the center of my screen.
* [Cycle layouts](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/cyclelayouts/)
    * Allows me to easily switch layouts with one keybinding.
* [Fullgaps](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/fullgaps/)
    * Pretty gaps!!! In all seriousness, this helps me actually see what's in each window.
* [Moveresize](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/moveresize/)
    * Let's me resize floating windows with keybinds.
* [Resize corners](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/resizecorners/)
    * Lets me easily resize floating windows with my mouse.
* [Restart Signal](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/restartsig/)
    * Allows for easily killing and restarting dwm.
* [Scratchpad](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/scratchpad/)
    * Adds a nice scratchpad for typing something quick out.

All credit goes to the original authors of these patches, and I am very thankful that they exist,
I myself have not written any patches yet, but I hope to do so soon,
